Ok, so i have been thinking and I have come up with an idea...
If I use an if loop, it will be way easier! This means that I will have to make something like this:

for i in range(1, 13):
(indent)posx=0, posy=0
(create button with posx, posy etc...)
posx=posx+10
posy=posy+10


That code MAY work, I will ahve to test it out...
